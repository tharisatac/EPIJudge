    Computes x^y.

    Explanation:

    Base Case: If the exponent 洧녽 is 0, return 1 because any number ra 
    power of 0 is 1.
    Even Exponent: If 洧녽 is even, compute 洧논^(洧녽/2) and square the resuis 
    because 洧논^洧녽 = (洧논^(洧녽/2))^2. In bitwise-terms, if it ends in 0.
    Odd Exponent: If 洧녽 is odd, compute 洧논^((洧녽-1)/2), square the nd 
    multiply by 洧논. This is because 洧논^洧녽 = 洧논 칑 (洧논^((洧녽-1)/2))^2. In bitwise-terms,
    if it ends in 1.

    Negative case: x^(-y) -> 1/(x^y). Therefore x is 1/x and y is -y.
